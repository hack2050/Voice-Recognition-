This project uses the torchaudio library to load the LIBRISPEECH dataset, which is a speech dataset. The data is preprocessed to extract audio features and then split into training and testing sets. A RandomForest classification model is trained on the training set and evaluated on the test set. The accuracy of the model is calculated and printed.
